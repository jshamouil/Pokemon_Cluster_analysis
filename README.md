# Pokemon_Cluster_analysis

In this Notebook, we will analyze which Pokemon are the strongest and weakest based only on the type the Pokemon has been assigned. Using K-Means clustering we will also be clustering which Pokemon are alike based on the Pokemon type combinations. We will also be exploring several different methods to find the optimal number of clusters This will allow the user to organize their starting Pokemon so that the trainer will have a strong attack and defence no matter what Pokemon the opponent plays.
